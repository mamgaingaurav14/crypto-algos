# CRYPTO_ALGO 

## Project Description
This project contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms such as **RSA, diffie-hellman, AES ,SHA **, etc., from scratch in **C++**.  
Currently, the cryptosystem includes an implementation of the **RSA algorithm & diffie-hellman** and other algorithims are ongoing construction.
